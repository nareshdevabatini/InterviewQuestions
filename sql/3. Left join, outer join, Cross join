Cross Join: 
If table1 and table2 matches 3 rows then it'll get 3*3 
ex: select * from Person cross join PersonOrders
Person has 10 rows and PersonOrders has 8 rows
ans: 10*8 = 80 

Left Join:
select * from Person p
left  join PersonOrders po on p.Id=po.PersonId
for Person table there is no 9, 10 foreign key ref so null column will for person address table
