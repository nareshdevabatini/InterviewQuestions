What are Temporary Tables in SQL Server?
Temporary Tables are tables that are temporarily created for a particular session. Once the session is terminated, the temporary tables 
are automatically deleted. In other words, these are the physical tables, which are created in tempdb database in SQL Server.

Since the Temporary Tables are physical tables, while reading from the table, SQL Optimizer puts a read lock on the table.

What are Table Variables in SQL Server?

Table variables are laid out like tables. They are partially stored both in the memory and in the disk.
They can be declared in batch or stored procedure. Unlike Temporary Tables, they cannot be dropped explicitly. 
Once the batch execution is finished, the Table Variables are dropped automatically.

Since the Table Variables are partially stored in the memory, they cannot be accessed by any other user or process that the current user. 
Therefore, no read lock is put on the Table Variable.
