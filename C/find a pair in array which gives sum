Input
Array=[8,2,3,1]  snf dum=7 output NA
Array=[1,3,9,5] and sum=8 ouput[3,5]
Array=[2,2,1,5] and sum=4 output[2,2]

solution should be generic it should work for any input of array length
solution with nested for loop will not be accepted
solution with complexity less than 0(n^2) will only be considered
You can provide more than one solution as well
