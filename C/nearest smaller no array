Write a program to find the nearest smaller no array for the given array. Neares smaller no is the no which is smaller than the given no
and nearest to the given numbers positionn. if no such no is found print-1

For ex, the given array is [8,2,4,5,1,6,0,3,2] then the nearest smaller no array is [2,,1,2,1,0,0,-1,0,0]. for fist number 8 nearest 
smaller no than 8 is 2. for seacon no 2 neareast smaller number than 2 is 1. Similarly for all no the nearest smaller no should be found. 
for seventho no 0 no smaller no is found in the array. so -1 is given in seven position.

input format: first line contains the no of elements in array N. Second line contains N numbers seperated by spaces.

Output format: Single line contains N nubers separated by spaces, where each no is the nearest smaller no of the giver no in that position.

Sample Input
9
8 2 4 5 1 6 0 3 2

sample output 
2 1 2 1 0 0 -1 0 0
