write a program to find the min no of multiplication iperation to fine k**n(k to the power n)
for ex if k=3 and n=6 then 

3**6=(((3*3)*3)**2)
Norma multiplication =>1 operation
square multiplication => 1 operration 
so your output should be 3

constraints
1 <=T <=25
0<=k <= 100
0 <= n <= (2**64)-1

Note: this cannot bbe solved using normal iteration mthod

Input Format:
First line contains number of test cases T
Following T line contains 2 nos separted by spacke K and n

Output Famat:
A single no which is the minimum no of operation should be printed for each test case per line

Sample Input:
1
3 6

Sample Output:
3
